description = "Accomodate and fix accessiblilty deficiencies
in core and contributed module.  Works on a case by case basis with hooks like
hook_form_alter to modify other modules forms and markup.  As a rule, these
are either stop gap measures until real fixes are made in modules or when
accessibility implementation is unclear or preference based."
